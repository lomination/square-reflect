This project is the very beginning of a try of reimplementation of [SquareReflect](https://github.com/lomination/SquareReflect) in Scala.

### The game

SquareReflect is a 2D maze game with open mechanics thanks to infinite possibilities of tiles.

This game allows you to play a small character lost in a level and your goal is to reach the end of the level. No gravity physics make you continue your way until you hit a tile that can allow you to choose a new direction to go.
